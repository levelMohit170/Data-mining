In this technique, the model is trained and evaluated K times, with each of the K folds used as a testing set exactly once, and the remaining K-1 folds used as the training data. The performance of the model is then calculated by averaging the evaluation results from each of the K iterations. K-fold cross-validation helps to mitigate the issue of overfitting by using all available data for both training and testing, and provides a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",

    "####    K-Fold Validation\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the available data into K subsets or folds. In this technique, the model is trained and evaluated K times, with each of the K folds used as a testing set exactly once, and the remaining K-1 folds used as the training data. The performance of the model is then calculated by averaging the evaluation results from each of the K iterations. K-fold cross-validation helps to mitigate the issue of overfitting by using all available data for both training and testing, and provides a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
